This template serves as the boilerplate code to develop browser extension using [Bun](https://bun.sh/) & [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for modular tooling for Typescript development, [React](https://react.dev/) for the user interface and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for flexible styling.

The main aim is to offer the simple template to get started with the browser extension using Bun, an all-in-one JavaScript runtime & toolkit.

The project is based upon [chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite-typescript](https://github.com/himalaya0035/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite-typescript/) and [create-chrome-ext](https://github.com/guocaoyi/create-chrome-ext).

## Features

- üöÄ Speedy development using [Bun](https://bun.sh/) integrated toolkit and Vite's fast HMR
- üõ†Ô∏è Automated extension manifest file generation using [CRXJS Vite-Plugin](https://crxjs.dev/vite-plugin)
- ‚öõÔ∏è React-powered user interface along with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for quick & easy styling
- üóÉÔ∏è Out of the box support for Popup, Options, Background Script, ConctentScript, DevTools, NewTab and SidePanel (use @crxjs/vite-plugin 2.x-beta)
